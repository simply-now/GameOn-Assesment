    <h1>GameOn Front-end takehome assignment</h1>
    <p>Hello! Welcome to the GameOn take home assignment! ＼(＾▽＾)／</p>
    <p>
      The goal of this assignment is to check that you have the base skills
      necessary to be successful on the team. Don't worry, there's no secret
      tricks, or super special answers we're looking for. We are not looking to
      "take off points" for random trivial things like mispelling a variable
      name. That being said, do focus on making sure your solution is not
      "sloppy." Make it clean, simple, and clear. We want you to succeed!

    </p>
    <p>A few general considerations before we get started:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This assignment should take less than two hours or so (including the
        time to read the instructions).
      </li>
      <li>
        Submit your solution within 48 hours of receiving this. Use this form to
        submit.

    </ul>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Your task is to implement a chat renderer!</p>
    <p>
      You will receive a simluated message object via our mock API class. Your
      task is to take this message and render it in the
      <code>main</code> element in this file.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Write all your JS code in the <code>main.js</code> file in the root
        directory, don't worry about modularity, this project doesn't have a JS
        bundling pipeline, so it's fine to add all your code directly in the
        main file.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a new message from our simulated bot is received, the
        <code>handleMessageReceived</code> callback is invoked with the message
        object.
      </li>
      <li>
        Message objects adhere to the following structure:
        <pre><code>
{
  text: string, // optional
  items: [
    {
      url: string,
      thumbnailUrl: string,
      title: string,
      cta: string
    }
  ], // optional
  timestamp: number
}
        </code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        For each of the messages received, render the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If a message contains a <code>text</code> property, your program
            should render the text within a chat bubble first.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a message contains an <code>items</code> property, your program
            should render a horizontally scrolling list of media items. Each
            media item will always have a <code>url</code>,
            <code>thumbnailUrl</code>, <code>title</code>, and
            <code>cta</code> properties. Items should be laid out horizontally
            in order. If there are more items that can fit horizontally, the
            user should be able to scroll to the right using the browser native
            scrolling behavior (using the scrollbar, or by pressing
            <em>Shift</em> and scrolling with their mouse wheel).
          </li>
          <li>
            Lastly, all messages will include a <code>timestamp</code> property
            (in milliseconds) when they were sent. Your program should render
            the time the message was received in the following format:
            <code>MMM DD, HH:MM period</code> (e.g. <em>Feb 24, 1:47 PM</em>)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You are not expected to validate the message structure, you can assume
        message objects will always adhere to the spec above.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can change anything on the HTML and css files, if you need a new DOM
        structure, or anything, you can change the HTML to your heart's content.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can render the messages using whatever means you want. You can use
        plain javascript to append DOM elements into the chat area, or you can
        use a JS framework and create a component if you're more comfortable
        with that, or anything else. If you decide to use a framework, you can
        use the simplest means to load it, like adding a script tag and loading
        it from UNPKG or any other CDN. You definitely don't need to add any JS
        bundling or tooling to this project.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are encouraged to add basic animations or any other bells and
        whistles to the rendered messages if you want.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reference</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a basic design reference for what the rendered chat can look like,
      you are welcome to follow this spec precisely, or deviate from it and make
      it your own, you are not required to follow this spec at all.
